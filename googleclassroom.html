        <h3>A side project reimagining key features of Google Classroom.</h3>
        <div class="projecthero">
            <p>
                According to Google in 2021, 150 million students, educators and school administrators use Google
                Classroom. The pandemic required teachers, students and families to become proficient with tools they
                may have never used before in a short amount of time. While these tools are powerful and useful, they
                are not perfect, and I have designed two slight changes that I believe can improve the user experience
                in Google Classroom. This is a project I have created on my own and not through any affiliation with
                Google Classroom. </p>

            <p>After experiencing some frustrating work flow issues in Google Classroom I conducted user interviews with
                a group of teachers and the two most common pain points were:</p>

            <h2>Problem 1: Student View</h2>
            <p>
                When schools made the switch to remote school, teachers often needed to help students and families learn
                how to use Google Classroom effectively. For many of the assignments, students were required to take a
                picture of physical work they had completed and upload the picture. I often needed to walk students and
                parents step by step how to do this but in the beginning it was very difficult because the view that I
                was seeing on my end of Google Classroom as a teacher looked different than what the student was seeing.
                This made my job more difficult and time consuming when I didn't know how to describe what the button
                looked like that the student needed to click.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>My proposed solution is to include an option for the teacher to see what the assignment will look like
                from the student's view. This will allow the teacher to more accurately describe to the student which
                buttons to click to attach work, mark the assignment as done, or turn in work while being in a different
                physical space than the student. This can reduce the amount of time the teacher is troubleshooting
                technical issues with students and families.</p>

            <h2>Problem 2: Comment Bank Work Flow</h2>
            <p>
                According to a survey conducted by Scholastic, teachers spend an average of 95 minutes per day grading
                student work, which includes comments about the work. During remote school I often graded 50 or more
                assignments per day and in order to optimize my work flow I utilized the comment bank feature in Google
                Classroom. This feature did save time by allowing me to reuse saved comments, however the layout of the
                comment bank feature could be more streamlined. Currently on the grading screen the teacher must click
                the comment bank icon, click the copy button on the comment, click the grading icon, then paste the
                comment in the comment box. There is also the issue that the teacher can not see the comments already
                posted while viewing the comment bank.</p>
            <div class="imagegrid imagegridoverflow">

                </figure>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Instead of replacing the grading field with the comment bank, my proposed solution is for the comment
                bank to open to the left of the grading field when the user clicks the comment bank icon. Keeping the
                grading field visible while viewing the comment bank reduces the amount of clicks, streamlines the work
                flow and allows the teacher to see comments that have already been made while viewing the comment bank.

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p><strong>Some valuable takeaways I gained from this experience are:</strong></p>
            <p>1. The change from teaching remotely compared to in-person required much more time on the computer and I
                discovered the importance of streamlining work flow.</p>
            <p>2. Student engagement improves when students can easily interface with their needed tools. When they
                become frustrated they begin checking out. Once I was able to see what students saw on their screens I
                was able to help students much more quickly.</p>
            <p>3. Small changes to user interfaces based on user input can drastically change the experiences of users.
