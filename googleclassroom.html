        <h3>A side project reimagining key features of Google Classroom.</h3>

            <h3 class="center">
                According to Google in 2021, 150 million students, educators and school administrators use Google
                Classroom. The pandemic required teachers, students and families to become proficient with tools they
                may have never used before in a short amount of time. While these tools are powerful and useful, they
                are not perfect, and I have designed two slight changes that I believe can improve the user experience
                in Google Classroom. This is a project I have created on my own and not through any affiliation with
                Google Classroom. </h3>

            <p>After experiencing some frustrating work flow issues in Google Classroom I conducted user interviews with
                a group of teachers and the two most common pain points were:</p>

            <h2>Problem 1: Student View</h2>
            <p>
                When schools made the switch to remote school, teachers often needed to help students and families learn
                how to use Google Classroom effectively. For many of the assignments, students were required to take a
                picture of physical work they had completed and upload the picture. I often needed to walk students and
                parents step by step how to do this but in the beginning it was very difficult because the view that I
                was seeing on my end of Google Classroom as a teacher looked different than what the student was seeing.
                This made my job more difficult and time consuming when I didn't know how to describe what the button
                looked like that the student needed to click.</p>
            <div class="imagegrid imagegridoverflow">
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/Current Teacher View.png" style="max-width: 514px; max-height: 311px;">
                    <figcaption class="center">Current Teacher View</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/Current Student View.png" style="max-width: 514px; max-height: 311px;">
                    <figcaption class="center">Current Student View</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>My proposed solution is to include an option for the teacher to see what the assignment will look like
                from the student's view. This will allow the teacher to more accurately describe to the student which
                buttons to click to attach work, mark the assignment as done, or turn in work while being in a different
                physical space than the student. This can reduce the amount of time the teacher is troubleshooting
                technical issues with students and families.</p>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>While creating this prototype I gained experience in:</p>
            <p><strong>Creating a competitive audit analysis.</strong> I found creating a competitive audit interesting
                and insightful
                because it helped me narrow down specific features that I thought would bring value to my prototype as
                well as gave me the opportunity to analyze what other apps were doing successfully.</p>
            <p><strong>Iterating on an idea based on user testing.</strong> Originally I designed a wireframe map with
                the tour routes on
                the map and planned on that being the way users would choose a route. However, testers were confused
                about how to choose a route so I adjusted my design and now the map is used for navigation only and
                users choose a route from a list.</p>
            <p><strong>Creating a storyboard.</strong> For this prototype I found that creating a storyboard was
                particularly valuable to
                understanding a user's needs because one of the main features of this app would be to use it in a
                specific location. Making a storyboard to walk through the user's experience helped me narrow down the
                features I wanted to include.</p>
            <p><strong>Animating the prototype in Figma.</strong> I had created mockups in Figma before but this was my
                first experience
                with creating animations in Figma. I found the Smart Animate feature very helpful and intuitive in
                creating my interactions.</p>
