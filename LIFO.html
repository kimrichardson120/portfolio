            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>The LIFO application is an internal web application that allows users to complete quarterly tasks related
                to LIFO tax accounting based on four different processes. There was a two part need for this
                application; the legacy system that the manual processes were based on was being retired and was not
                scalable. Our users needed a seamless, more efficient way to complete these tasks that could be scaled
                in the future. Our business users required reports to view and edit existing data and ways to upload
                files that would write to a database used to calculate LIFO tax information. They also needed a way to
                generate a sample of stores and pharmacies to conduct LIFO inventories. The current state processes
                the users had were extremely manual requiring a lot of emailing files back and forth, navigating
                multiple systems and working with a contract team to manually update the database using those files. We
                sought a solution that would
                streamline the processes and reduce the amount of manual work. While all four processes impacted the
                LIFO calculations, they each had unique needs that had to be considered to create a useful application
                for our end users.

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>I collaborated with my PM and engineering to conduct discovery and research. These processes are unique
                to a large enterprise, therefore we relied on collaborating with our subject matter experts and business
                users regularly. I led multiples sessions of interviews with the subject matter experts for each of the
                four processes and then distilled our research into experience briefs and process maps. These artifacts
                guided the designs I made regarding user flows and UI design, along with regular brainstorming sessions
                with my product and technology counterparts. </p>

        <section>
            <h2>User Flows</h2>
            <p>Each of the four processes had its own user flow. Creating these artifacts helped our team visualize the
                steps the user needed to take for each process.

            <h2>Site Map and Information Architecture</h2>
            <p>I find creating site maps and information architecture for the application is helpful for me to visualize
                how the different parts and pages of the web app go together. It also helps the team to align on which
                pages or screens we may be discussing during collaboration sessions.

        <section>
            <h2>Low Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
            <p>Based on the research I was then ready to create low-fidelity wireframes. Since we held weekly touch base
                meetings with our business users I was able to get feedback often and iterate based on that feedback.
                Working in low-fidelity helped me work more efficiently. </p>
            <div class="imagegrid">
                <img src="images/LIFOCP1.png">

            </div>
            <p>
                As this
                product is an internal accounting tool, I have not included images of the high-fidelity prototypes or
                the production application.

        <section>
            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>The impact for our business users is that they can now work more easily and efficiently on their tasks.
                For example, the Store Sampler use case has completely automated the creation of a sample that was
                previously created by a user looking at a list of thousands of stores and counting down every twenty
                stores and copy and pasting that store name to a sample list. This saves hours of manual work for this
                task alone. The Warehouse Exception Report allows users to stay in one application while editing items;
                the system will automatically make the changes to the database. It also includes a history of changes
                and comments that provides auditing accountability between users that they didn't previously have. It
                allows different users to research in the application why a change on an item was made. This product had
                some very challenging aspects because the processes for the four use cases are all very different and
                complex. It required a great deal of research and digging in to understand the very specific needs of
                enterprise accountants working on unique work flows. We have received positive feedback from our users
                that the application has reduced their workload and created labor savings. The LIFO process which needs
                to be very accurate and our application facilitates this for our business.
