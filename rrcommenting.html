            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>The first product on which I lead design on in my current role is a receipt reconciliation application
                used by accountants. This application was created to offer a way for accountants to research receipts
                and purchase orders (POs) that were out of balance and needed to be reconciled. Since the receipts and
                POs are being reported at an enterprise level, there are a large quantity of items that need to be
                reconciled and multiple accountants work together to help each other research and reconcile these
                receipts and POs. The accountants needed a way better way to communicate with each other about specific
                receipts and/or POs to work more efficiently and create labor savings. </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>I collaborated with the User Research team to create a research plan, including a competitive analysis,
                discussion guide and moderated testing plan. After conducting the competitive analysis I presented my
                findings and recommendations to stakeholders. </p>
            <h4>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS OBJECTIVES</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>To explore commenting features in other products</li>
                <li>To review commenting functionality in other products</li>
                <li>To evaluate the key strengths and weaknesses in commenting features</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>RECOMMENDATIONS</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Each comment displays the user who created the comment</li>
                <li>Each comment has a timestamp with the date and time</li>
                <li>Each comment is separated by a line</li>
                <li>A comment icon is displayed in each line item field to
                    indicate where a user can add or view a comment</li>
                <li>A modal opens or a panel slides over to view or add comments</li>
                <li>A comment icon is displayed in each line item field to
                    indicate where a user can add or view a comment</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is the user flow for a user who is viewing and/or adding comments.

            <h2>Low Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
            <p>After conducting the competitive analysis and collaborating with my product team, I sketched some
                potential designs for how the commenting feature would work in our product.</p>
            <div class="imagegrid">
                <img src="images/CommentingLowFi.jpeg">
                <img src="images/CommetingLowFi2.jpeg">
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>The design that I landed on was to create a sliding panel that would move in from the right once the user
                has clicked the comment icon. The user can view and/or add comments in the sliding panel. There is also
                a record of who made each comment and when the comment was made. As this product is an application used
                for accounting, we did not give the user the ability to delete or edit comments as an audit trail is
                very important in accounting practices. I conducted user testing with 5 accountants to confirm that the
                user experience was effective. Once I analyzed the results of the user testing I collaborated with the
                Kroger design system team to get approval for this new user flow because no other internal Kroger
                application had a robust commenting feature.
            </p>
            <p>Since this feature has been in production, we have made an iteration on where the comment icon is placed
                so that it is more clearly visible to the user if the table has a horizontal scroll on it. As this
                product is an internal accounting tool, I have not included images of the high-fidelity prototypes or
                the production application.
            </p>

            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>
                The commenting feature in the reconciliation application has improved the work efficiency of the
                accountants who use the application. The users now can comment directly on an item during their
                research; in the past the comments lived in Teams channels, ExCel sheets, emails, etc. The labor savings
                has been estimated at 5 minutes per receipt/PO and as most accountants work multiple POs per hour, this
                labor savings quickly adds up.
            </p>
            <p>Another impact this feature has is that it is the first commenting flow used in an internal Kroger
                application comprised of components from the Kroger Design System. I worked with the design system team
                to approve the design and it is included in the Supply Chain, Manufacturing, Finance and Accounting
                (SCMFA) pillar design library roadmap to be implemented in the SCMFA design system.
